The selection of the optimum set of variables to include in a BN (‚Äúvariable selection‚Äù) is therefore a key part of the BN modelling process. While variable selection is an issue dealt with in the wider BN and machine learning literature, it remains largely absent from environmental BN applications to date, due in large part to a lack of software designed to work with available BN packages. CVNetica_VS is an open-source Python module that extends the functionality of Netica, a commonly used commercial BN software package, to perform variable selection. CVNetica_VS uses wrapper-based variable selection and cross-validation to search for the optimum variable set to use in a BN.

Results reveal that supervised discretization methods produced BNs of the highest average predictive skill (73.8%), followed by manual discretization (69.0%) and unsupervised discretization (64.8%). However, each method has specific advantages that may make them more suitable for particular applications. Manual methods can produce physical meaningful BNs, which is favorable in environmental modelling. Supervised methods can autonomously and optimally discretize variables and may be preferred when predictive skill is a modelling priority. Unsupervised methods are computationally simple and versatile.

A BN may be suited to descriptive or predictive application. Descriptive BNs are highly calibrated models that are useful for better understanding the physics and causal relationships driving a system. Predictive BNs are generalisations of a system that have skill at predicting outside of the training domain. The predictive and descriptive usefulness of a BN depends on its complexity and the amount of data available to train it, but there is often a trade-off; higher descriptive skill comes at the cost of reduced predictive skill. To demonstrate the differences between predictive and descriptive BNs in a coastal engineering context, a BN to predict shoreline recession caused by coastal storm events is developed and tested using an extensive 10-year dataset incorporating 137 individual storms events monitored at Narrabeen-Collaroy Beach, Australia. A parsimonious approach to BN development is used to separately determine the optimum predictive and descriptive BNs for this dataset. Results show that for this dataset two quite different BNs can be developed; one that is optimized to achieve the highest predictive skill, and a second network that is optimized to maximize descriptive skill. The optimum predictive BN is found to comprise 3 nodes (variables) and can predict the shoreline recession caused by unseen storm events with a skill of 65%. The optimum descriptive BN is composed of 5 nodes and can reproduce 88% of the training dataset, but with more limited predictive capabilities. The uses and limitations of these two different approaches to BN formulation are illustrated with example applications to coastal process modelling. It is anticipated that the insights provided in this paper will help to clarify the further development of Bayesian Networks applied to coastal modelling.","tags":["Bayesian network, storm erosion, coastal processes, coastal modelling"],"title":"Bayesian Networks in coastal engineering: Distinguishing descriptive and predictive applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Atkinson","Tom Baldock","Florent Birrien","David Callaghan","Peter Nielsen","Tomas Beuzen","Ian Turner","Chris Blenkinsopp","Roshanka Ranasinghe"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

In this work, new insight into the response of sandy beaches to sea level rise is obtained through a series of compre- hensive experiments using monochromatic and random waves in medium scale laboratory wave flumes. Beach profile development from initially planar profiles, and a 2/3 power law profile, exposed to wave conditions that formed barred or bermed profiles and subsequent profile evolution following rises in water level and the same wave conditions are presented. Experiments assess profile response to a step-change in water level as well as the influence of sediment deposition above the still water level (e.g. overwash). A continuity based profile translation model (PTM) is applied to both idealised and measured shoreface profiles, and is used to predict overwash and deposition volumes above the shoreline. Quantitative agreement with the Bruun Rule (and variants of it) is found for measured shoreline recession for both barred and bermed beach profiles. There is some variability between the profiles at equilibrium at the two different water levels. Under these idealised conditions, deviations between the original Bruun Rule, the modification by Rosati et al. (2013) and the PTM model predictions are of the order of 15% and all these model predictions are within 30% of the observed shoreline recession. Measurements of the recession of individual contour responses, such as the shoreline, may be subject to local profile variability; therefore, a measure of the mean recession of the profile is also obtained by averaging the recession of discrete contours throughout the active profile. The mean recession only requires conservation of volume, not conser- vation of profile shape, to be consistent with the Bruun Rule concept, and is found to be in better agreement with all three model predictions than the recession measured at the shoreline.","tags":["sea level rise, coastal erosion, Bruun rule, coastal management, sediment transport"],"title":"Laboratory investigation of the Bruun Rule and beach response to sea level rise","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Beuzen","Ian Turner","Chris Blenkinsopp","Alex Atkinson","Francois Flocard","Tom Baldock"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The response of natural sandy beaches to SLR has been much discussed in the literature, however there is a lack of knowledge about the impact of SLR on engineered coasts. Laboratory experiments comprising over 320 h of testing were conducted in a 44 m (L) x 1.2 m (W) x 1.6 m (D) wave flume to investigate the in- fluence of coastal armouring in the form of seawalls on coastal response to SLR. The study was designed to investigate the effects of contrasting types of seawalls (reflective-impermeable versus dissipative-permeable) on beach profile response to increased water levels, in the presence of both erosive and accretionary wave conditions. The results obtained showed that seawalls alter the evolution of the equilibrium profile with rising water level, causing increased lowering of the profile adjacent to the structure. Under erosive wave conditions, modelled profiles both with and without seawall structures in place were observed to translate landward in response to SLR and erode the upper profile. It was found that the erosion demand at the upper beach due to a rise in water level remains similar whether a structure is present or not, but that a seawall concentrates the erosion in the area adjacent to the seawall, resulting in enhanced and localised profile lowering. The type of structure present (dissipative-permeable versus reflective-impermeable) was not observed to have a significant influence on this response. Under accretive conditions, the preservation of a large shoreface and berm resulted in no wave-structure interaction occurring, with the result that the presence of a seawall had no impact on profile evolution. A potential two-step method for estimating the observed profile response to water level rise in the presence of seawalls is proposed, whereby a simple profile translation model is used to provide a first estimate of the erosion demand, and then this eroded volume is redistributed in front of the seawall out to the position of the offshore bar.","tags":["sea level rise, seawalls, coastal erosion, Bruun rule, coastal management"],"title":"Physical model study of beach profile evolution by sea level rise in the presence of seawalls","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomas Beuzen","Chris Chickadel","Alexander Horner-Devine"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Boil activity has previously been linked to the amount of aeration occurring in river systems. A synthesis of data across an ebb tide showed that when a tidal salinity intrusion retreated, turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rapidly increased by 700% and 575%, respectively. Additionally, the mean boil area fraction in the IR field of view increased by almost 500% across the entire ebb tide time series, with approximately half of this change occurring during the period when the stratification ceased. Using an empirical method for estimating aeration, the change in areal fraction associated with the loss of density stratification is predicted to generate a more than 300% increase in the air-water gas flux.","tags":["aeration, rivers, stratification, thermal imaging, turbulence"],"title":"Physical model study of beach profile evolution by sea level rise in the presence of seawalls","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"http://TomasBeuzen.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

BNs are probabilistic graphical models that are able to represent complex physical systems with the benefits of very low computational cost, intrinsic handling of uncertainty and error, and explicit description of causation and relationships between variables within the system. BNs can be used for both predictive and diagnostic inference, and are particularly suitable for application to management tools, as they are explicit in uncertainty, give outputs in probability distributions, and are relatively straight-forward to integrate within existing risk analysis and decision-making frameworks. The general steps in developing a Bayesian Network are described. An example application to predict the degree of shoreline erosion caused by coastal storms is then presented, based on a data set spanning 10 years that includes 137 individual storm events. Located at Collaroy-Narrabeen Beach in Sydney, Australia, an optimised BN is shown to correctly predict the extent of storm erosion (‚Äòextreme‚Äô, ‚Äòmild‚Äô, ‚Äòno-change‚Äô) 65% of the time when applied to unseen storm events. Sensitivity analysis shows that incident wave power and pre-storm shoreline position were the most sensitive parameters in the BN for predicting storm erosion at this site. The application of the BN to the June 2016 major ECL storm at Collaroy-Narrabeen shows how this simple approach could potentially be used in a real-world forecast application to inform emergency management decisions and assist with community preparedness. While possible, the development of a more complex BN with higher predictive skill requires more observation data than was available to this study, and is the topic of future work.","tags":["shoreline prediction, storms, shoreline erosion, Bayesian network"],"title":"Predicting storm erosion on sandy coastlines using a Bayesian network","type":"publication"}]
